## About

The Mentors App is a simple application developed using UIKit. It displays information about mentors and allows users to add new ones by tapping the "+" button on the Navigation Bar and completing the form.
The project's goal is to showcase basic UIKit elements and concepts:

- MVC design pattern

- Storyboards

- UILabels, UITextfields, UIButtons

- UITableViewControllers, UITableViews, UITableViewCells

- NavigationControllers

- Segues

- @IBOutlets

- AutoLayout

By exploring the project, you can learn how to create a simple storyboard App.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Workshop-Developing-Apps-with-UIKit
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file

### How to

1. Explore the `Mentors Appp` project files

2. Run the app(⌘+R) and test it

3. Once you have a good understanding of the concepts used in the project, try implementing the same views using different components. For example, you could use a CollectionView instead of the TableView.

Remember to use the MVC design pattern to separate your app's logic and use AutoLayout to ensure that your views look great on different devices and orientations. Good luck with your exploration and implementation!
